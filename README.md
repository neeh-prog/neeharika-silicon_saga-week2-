## üîπ What is a System-on-Chip (SoC)?
A **System-on-Chip (SoC)** is an integrated circuit that integrates multiple essential system components into a single silicon chip.  
Instead of having separate chips for CPU, memory, and peripherals, SoC unifies them, improving **performance, efficiency, and size optimization**.  

## üîπ Why SoCs Are Awesome (Advantages)

| **Advantage** | **Description** |
|---------------|------------------|
| **Energy Efficiency** | Components are closely packed, reducing data travel distance and minimizing power loss. Crucial for battery-operated devices. |
| **Space Saving** | Consolidating multiple chips into one drastically reduces the overall footprint. Enables smaller, more portable devices. |
| **High Performance** | Faster communication between internal components (low latency) results in quicker data processing. |
| **Cost Effective** | Manufacturing a single, highly integrated chip is generally cheaper than manufacturing and assembling many separate components. |
| **Reliability** | Fewer physical interconnects and solder points mean fewer potential points of failure. |

## üîπ Components of a Typical SoC

| **Component** | **Function** | **Role in Device Performance** |
|---------------|--------------|--------------------------------|
| **CPU (Central Processing Unit)** | The "brain"; handles main instructions, calculations, data processing, and application management. | Executes general-purpose tasks and dictates overall processing speed. |
| **GPU (Graphics Processing Unit)** | Show visuals, manages graphics processing for display, gaming, and animations. | Critical for a smooth user interface, high-resolution video, and gaming performance. |
| **DSP (Digital Signal Processor)** | Specialized for processing audio, video, and other continuous signals. | Enables features like noise reduction, voice recognition, and real-time media encoding/decoding. |
| **Memory (RAM, ROM/Flash)** | RAM stores temporary data for running applications; ROM/Flash stores permanent system and user data. | Determines the device's multitasking capability and overall storage capacity. |
| **I/O Ports (Input/Output)** | Connects the chip to external devices like cameras, sensors, USB, and audio devices. | Allows the SoC to send and receive data from the outside world. |
| **Power Management Unit (PMU)** | Regulates voltage and current, managing power distribution across all blocks. | Essential for optimizing energy efficiency and extending battery life. |
| **Special Features** | Includes connectivity modules (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS), security engines, and hardware accelerators. | Provides wireless communication and enhances security and specific task speed (e.g., AI processing). |

## üîπ Soc Design Flow...

## üîπ Why BabySoC?
**BabySoC** is a simplified teaching model of an SoC.  
- Strips down complexity while retaining core concepts.  
- Helps beginners visualize how CPU, memory, and peripherals work together.  
- Provides a sandbox for learning **functional modelling** before diving into full-scale RTL design and physical implementation.  
- Ensures **step-by-step learning** without being overwhelmed by industrial-level SoC designs.  

 **The VSDBabySoC** is a small, specialized System on Chip (SoC) designed primarily as a testing ground for new components. 

 ## The main goal is two-fold:
-*First-Time Testing:* To integrate and test three specific, open-source hardware blocks (the RVMYTH, PLL, and DAC) together for the first time.
-*Analog Calibration:* To accurately tune its analog components (like the PLL and DAC) for reliable real-world use.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How the VSDBabySoC Works (The Process Flow) 
The chip follows a three-step cycle to generate an output signal:

*1. Initialization and Synchronization (The Clock)*
When the SoC turns on, the 8x PLL immediately activates.
Result: The PLL generates a precise, stable, and synchronized clock signal. This signal acts like a conductor , ensuring the RVMYTH and DAC operate at the exact same pace, preventing any timing errors or data corruption.

*2. Data Processing (The Digital Signal)*
The RVMYTH processor starts executing instructions.
Mechanism: It uses a dedicated area called the r17 register to hold and repeatedly update a sequence of digital values. This creates a continuous stream of digital data.

*3.  Analog Signal Generation (The Output)*
 The 10-bit DAC receives the constantly changing digital values from the RVMYTH's r17 register.
Result: The DAC translates these digital numbers into a physical, continuous analog electrical signal. This output, saved to a file named OUT, can then be used to drive external consumer devices (like older TVs or mobile audio ports) to produce sound or video.

### üìä BabySoC Components Breakdown  

| **Component** | **What It Is**              | **Its Job on the Chip** |
|---------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| **RVMYTH**    | A Microprocessor Core        |  It handles all the data processing and calculations, and cycles through the digital values to be converted. |
| **8x PLL**    | Phase-Locked Loop            |  It takes the initial input signal and generates a super-stable, synchronized clock signal for the entire system. |
| **10-bit DAC**| Digital-to-Analog Converter  | It takes the digital numbers from the RVMYTH and converts them into a continuous, usable analog signal. |


---

## üîÑ Phase-Locked Loop (PLL): The On-Chip Clock Synchronizer
A Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) is an essential control system that generates an output signal perfectly synchronized in phase and frequency with an input signal. It acts as an on-chip timing lock for the entire system.

*Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) Components and Key Mechanisms*

| **Component** / **Key Mechanism** | **Function** / **Details** |
|---------------------------|-----------------|
| **Phase Detector (PD)** | Compares the phase of the input (reference) signal with the PLL's output signal and generates an error voltage proportional to the difference. |
| **Loop Filter (LF)** | A low-pass filter that smooths the error voltage, filtering out noise and high-frequency components to produce a stable control voltage. |
| **Voltage-Controlled Oscillator (VCO)** | Generates the output signal, adjusting its frequency based on the control voltage from the Loop Filter. |
| **Core Goal** | To "lock" the output frequency to the input frequency, maintaining a constant (often zero) phase relationship. |
| **Frequency Multiplication** | By adding a frequency divider in the feedback path, the PLL can generate an output frequency that is an exact multiple of the input frequency. |

## Why On-Chip Clocks Are Important

1. **Timing & Distribution**
   - Long wiring on large chips causes delays; different parts may get the clock at slightly different times.
   - Off-chip clocks can suffer from **jitter**, reducing timing precision.

2. **Frequency Flexibility**
   - Chips often need multiple frequencies (e.g., CPU vs peripheral). PLLs can generate several synchronized clocks from one reference.

3. **Accuracy & Stability**
   - Quartz crystals have small frequency errors (ppm) that increase over time due to temperature changes and aging.
   - PLLs adjust continuously to maintain a precise and stable internal clock.

# üéõÔ∏è Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC): The Digital Translator

A **Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)** converts a digital input (0s and 1s) into a real-world analog signal (continuous voltage or current), allowing digital devices to interact with the physical world.

## Structure & Representation

| *Aspect* | *Description* |
|--------|------------|
| Digital Input | A series of binary bits. The number of bits (resolution) determines how many distinct analog levels the DAC can produce. |
| Physical Structure | Multiple binary inputs and a single continuous analog output. The number of inputs is usually a power of two (2, 4, 8, 16, etc.). |

## Common Types of DACs

| *Type* | *Description* |
|------|------------|
| Weighted Resistor DAC | Uses resistors with specific weights corresponding to each input bit (e.g., R, R/2, R/4‚Ä¶). |
| R-2R Ladder DAC | Uses a repeating network of only two resistor values (R and 2R). Simple to manufacture and scalable for higher resolutions. |

## DAC in VSDBabySoC

In the **VSDBabySoC**, the **10-bit DAC** converts digital data from the **RVMYTH processor** into a smooth analog voltage. This allows devices like TVs or mobile phones to produce sound or video from digital signals.


## üîπ Role of Functional Modelling
Before RTL design and physical implementation, **functional modelling** plays a critical role:  
- Allows early testing of **logic flow & interactions** between components.  
- Helps in validating the **architecture & specifications**.  
- Saves time and cost by identifying design issues before RTL synthesis.  
- Simulation tools like **Icarus Verilog** and **GTKWave** help visualize signals and ensure correctness at this conceptual stage.

## üìù Reflection
This task strengthened the foundation of **SoC thinking**  understanding not just the CPU, but the **entire system** as a unified design.  
By practicing **functional modelling with BabySoC**, we take the first step toward the **bigger picture** of RTL and physical design flow.

# TLV to Verilog Conversion for RVMYTH
Initially, you will see only the rvmyth.tlv file inside src/module/, since the RVMYTH core is written in TL-Verilog.
To convert it into a .v file for simulation, follow the steps below:
*üîß TLV to Verilog Conversion Steps*

```
# Step 1: Install python3-venv (if not already installed)
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-venv python3-pip

# Step 2: Create and activate a virtual environment
cd VSDBabySoC/
python3 -m venv sp_env
source sp_env/bin/activate

# Step 3: Install SandPiper-SaaS inside the virtual environment
pip install pyyaml click sandpiper-saas

# Step 4: Convert rvmyth.tlv to Verilog
sandpiper-saas -i ./src/module/*.tlv -o rvmyth.v --bestsv --noline -p verilog --outdir ./src/module/
```

# VSDBabySoC RTL to Gate-Level Simulation Flow

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ Pre-Synthesis Simulation:
   - Compile RTL with Icarus Verilog
   - Purpose: Verify RTL functionality before synthesis
   - Output: output/pre_synth_sim/pre_synth_sim.out and waveform .vcd
 
Run the following command to perform a pre-synthesis simulation:
```
iverilog -o output/pre_synth_sim/pre_synth_sim.out   -DPRE_SYNTH_SIM   -I src/include   -I src/module   src/module/testbench.v
```
![presynth](./assets/pre_synth%20terminal.png)

*Follow these commands in vsdbabysoc directory to see output in gtk wave*
 ```
 pre_synth_sim/
 ls
post_synth_sim.out  pre_synth_sim.out

```
![output](./assets/pre_synth%201.png)
![output](./assets/pre_synth%202.png)

- The continuous, sine-like wave (labeled OUT) confirms that the Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC) module is working correctly in the ideal, functional simulation. 
- The digital bus RV_TO_DAC[9:0] is showing changing values (e.g., 334 or 231 in other views). This proves that the RVMYTH processor core is actively generating and sending data to the DAC.

 **The pre-synthesis waveform verifies the logical correctness (functionality) of  design without worrying about the physical delays**

   - Purpose: Verify gate-level behavior matches RTL
   - Output: output/post_synth_sim/post_synth_sim.out and waveform .vcd
   Run the following command to perform a pre-synthesis simulation:

```
iverilog -o output/post_synth_sim/post_synth_sim.out -DPOST_SYNTH_SIM  -I src/include/ -I src/module/ src/module/testbench.v
